# SAR-Soil-Moisture
Soil moisture inversion from Sentinel-1 data processed with the Water Cloud Model.

CalculateForS.m is used to compute the relationship between sampling frequency and S-value calculations. 
CalculateForS2.m and CalculateForS3.m both serve to estimate the ground truth of S-values through distinct methodologies. 
CalculateForLSecondByX.m handles the computation of lateral scan data across the entire scanning regionã€‚ 
CalculateForLSecondByY.m processes longitudinal scan data for the same purpose. 
SoilMoistureCalculateWithICDM.m implements an improved change detection method (ICDM) for soil moisture estimation. 
vegSoilContent.m calculates vegetation-soil water content interactions. 
SARWithoutMveg.m corrects SAR data by mitigating vegetation effects.
